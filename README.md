# Annual Report

This repository contains the template of the annual report of the Working Group. Most, if not all, the content of the annual report is written in a Github flavour Markdown while Pandoc is used to compile it to a deliverable PDF. The compilation can be run as a workflow but also using `pandoc.sh` in the root of this repository.
