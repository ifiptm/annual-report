## Website, GitHub and social media
The WG 11.11 website is available at: [www.ifiptm.org](https://www.ifiptm.org/). The design and setup of the website have been recently updated but it is not complete at the time of writing this report. The information on it is being incrementally added.

The organisers of annual IFIPTM conferences are free to host and design their own conference websites or ask the IFIPTM Publicity Chair to do so. Each annual conference website used to be linked from the main WG website domain, using the short-link http://s.ifiptm.org. For example, in 2019 the conference website was linked as: http://s.ifiptm.org/conf2019. However, as of February 2022, the short-links are no longer available because [Google discontinued the service](https://support.google.com/a/answer/11568987?product_name=UnuFlow&visit_id=637898425575885123-779250421&rd=1&src=supportwidget0). Work will be done to link the conference websites in a consistent way in the future. As of now, we are in the process of linking the current and past IFIPTM events from the main website using a landing page for each, e.g., https://www.ifiptm.org/event/ifiptm2023/ for the IFIPTM 2023.

The WG 11.11 now has a GitHub presence at: [github.com/ifiptm](https://github.com/ifiptm/). It will contain public repositories such as that for the website, annual reports (such as this one), factsheet and so on; as well as private repositories visible to relevant members of the working group only.

The WG 11.11 also has a Twitter presence at: [@ifiptm](https://twitter.com/ifiptm).

Furthermore, the WG 11.11 also has an organisational profile on LinkedIn at: [www.linkedin.com/company/ifiptm](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ifiptm/).

## Events
The annual working conference,is the main event sponsored by the working group. The working conference was postponed for 2020, 2021 and 2022 due to the Covid-19 pandemic related travel disruptions, which has impaired the visibility of the working group and will impact recruitment of new members to the trust management community in the short term. With the emerging trust management issues arising from increasing digitalization of societies and the recent advances of AI/ML, the relevance of the working group is ever increasing and opportunities to co-sponsor events in other areas should be explored going forward.

### Report on WG meetings
WG 11.11 has held somewhat regular video conferences during the past year. Most of the work was accomplished via group emails, other messaging systems and other workgroup .

### Conferences
The 14th IFIP WG 11.11 International Conference on Trust Management (IFIP TM2020) was organised to be held from June 29--July 1 in Tel Aviv, Israel. Conference Chairs were Ehud Gudes (Ben-Gurion University, Israel) and Nurit Gal-Oz (Sapir Academic College, Israel). PC Chairs were Tim Muller (University of Nottingham, UK) and Carmen Fernandez-Gago (University of Malaga, Spain).
 
Unfortunately,  due to the unusual circumstances relating to COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions, and the state of emergency declared in many countries all over the world, the organising committee decided to cancel the IFIPTM 2020 and the IFIPTM 2021 conferences and merge these with the IFIPTM 2022 conference.

IFIPTM 2022 was planned to be held in Tel Aviv, Israel pending the global pandemic situation. However, the IFIPTM 2022 conference was also cancelled, because of the uncertainties introduced by different implementations of Covid-19 restrictions around the world. 

Papers received, reviewed and accepted for the 2021 conference will be invited to present at the IFIPTM 2023 conference following a lightweight update and review process; papers will be included in the conference proceedings for the 2023 conference.

### Other events
No other events have been scheduled or co-sponsored in 2022--23. 

## Publications
The main publication of the working group is the conference proceedings of the annual working conference, which was cancelled in 2022, so there was no officially sponsored publications of the working group in 2022--23.

### Proceedings
The proceedings of IFIPTM  are annually published by Springer in the series of "IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology (AICT)" under the auspices of the IFIP WG 11.11 on Trust Management.

## Membership
Per IFIP rules, membership is open to attendees of the conference or associated events, with a three year expiry.

## Other issues
The are no other issues that the working group wishes to raise at the moment.

### Award
The William Winsborough Commemorative Address and Award has been inaugurated to acknowledge the lasting effect that Professor Winsborough had on the field of Computational Trust and Trust Management. The award will be given annually.  "The objective of the award is to publicly recognise an individual, not a group or organisation, who has significantly contributed to the development of computational trust and/or trust management, especially achievements with an international perspective. However this particular requirement will not necessarily preclude nominations of those whose main achievements have been made on a national level."

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting postponement of the annual conference, no Winsborough Award was issued in 2020, 2021 and 2022, but the William Winsborough Commemorative Award is expected to be awarded again in 2023.

### Elections
Elections were held in September 2021 for a new Executive. The following Executive Committee was elected through proclamation and the new executive came into force from October 2021.
